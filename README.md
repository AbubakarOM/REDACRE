Framework: Cucumber with BDD Framework
Model I adopted: Page Object Model (POM)

Cypress enables QA Engineers to write all types of tests including, End-to-end tests, Integration tests and Unit tests. Cypress has the ability to test anything that runs in a browser.

Cypress has some features which are not in some other framework:

    Time Travel: Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run.

    Debuggability: It prevent QA Engineers to stop guessing why your tests are failing.

    Automatic Waiting: Never add waits or sleeps to your tests. Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on. No more async hell.

    Spies, Stubs, and Clocks: Verify and control the behavior of functions, server responses, or timers. The same functionality you love from unit testing is right at your fingertips.

    Network Traffic Control: Easily control, stub, and test edge cases without involving your server. 
    
    Screenshots and Videos: View screenshots taken automatically on failure, or videos of your entire test suite when run from the CLI.

    Cross browser Testing: Run tests within Firefox and Chrome-family browsers (including Edge and Electron) locally and optimally in a Continuous Integration pipeline.
